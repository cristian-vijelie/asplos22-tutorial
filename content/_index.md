## Unikraft ASPLOS'22 Tutorial

**To be held along with [International Conference on Architectural Support for
Programming Languages and Operating Systems
(ASPLOS'22)](https://asplos-conference.org)**.

With the advance of virtualization technology and the constant demand for
specialization, security and performance, unikernels are no longer a fringe
idea.  In this tutorial we present Unikraft, a unikernel SDK aiming for extreme
specialization.

Unikraft is an open source project with a growing and vibrant community
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft/) and
[Discord](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord).

This tutorial is highly practical.  We will provide remote access to
pre-configured machines where attendees will build, configure, run and measure
Unikraft-based software components.  The tutorial is planned to take place for 6
hours (e.g. 10am to 5pm - 1 hour break).  Each section of this tutorial consists
of a short presentation / demo (10-15 minutes) followed by practical work to be
done by each attendee on their allocated remote machine.  Trainers from the
Unikraft community will provide instructions and support to attendees during the
tutorial.
